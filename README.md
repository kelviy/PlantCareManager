## Plant Care Manager
# Welcome!

This is a School Project(PAT) from St.Benedict's College. 

The goal of the program is to store user entered data. This included Plant, Task and Encrypted Notes Data. The data would be displayed to the user like a typical GUI "To Do List" or "Notes" program.
The data is stored in text files which the program reads to initialise and display the data. 

The program is mostly finished, however, there are a lot of bugs and change possibly run slow.

I do plan to rebuilt the program from scratch when I am more proficient at programming in the future.
